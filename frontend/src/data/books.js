With nothing but his wits, scientific knowledge, and the courage to improvise, Grace must solve impossible problems in the emptiness of space—and he’s running out of time. From the bestselling author of 'The Martian,' 'Project Hail Mary' is a thrilling, funny, and surprisingly emotional tale of survival, discovery, and the bonds that can form in the most unexpected places."

    description: "It calls itself Murderbot—but don’t let the name fool you. This part-machine, part-human security android would rather spend its time binge-watching soap operas than interacting with people. Unfortunately, it’s stuck guarding a team of scientists on a distant planet. When a routine mission turns deadly, Murderbot is forced to confront both external threats and the uncomfortable reality of caring about the humans it’s supposed to protect. Blending sharp humor, gripping action, and surprisingly heartfelt moments, 'All Systems Red' is the first entry in Martha Wells’s beloved Murderbot Diaries—a series that redefines what it means to be human, even if you’re not entirely one."
